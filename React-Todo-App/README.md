# Todo application

This application is basically generating a task to do comes with a checkbox.
You can click it when u have completed the task.
Once you have completed the task and clicked the checkbox, you can not undo that checkbox to make it your task to do and can not delete that task. 

Login/Register fucntionality is added in this application, so anyone can login and add your tasks and check when its completed.

You guys can use this and implement your own applications of TODO lists.

This application is build only on ReactJs and the database I have used in this application is Firebase database which is an unstructured database and tailwind css for the designing the web page with responsive designs
